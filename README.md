# Neural Network Project for Student Loan Default Prediction

## Overview

This project trains a binary classification model to predict student loan default based on historical data.

### Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scales features, and encodes categorical variables.
- Model Training: Trains a sequential neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Model Saving: Saves the trained model to a file for future use.
- Model Loading: Loads the saved model for prediction.
- Prediction: Makes predictions on new data using the loaded model.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras 2.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

### Installation

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the code: python binary_classification_model.py

### Usage

Run the code to train and evaluate the model.
